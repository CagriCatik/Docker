# Images & Containers

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into two fundamental concepts of Docker: images and containers. Understanding these core components is crucial for effectively utilizing Docker in your projects.

## Overview

When working with Docker, it's essential to grasp the concepts of images and containers. Let's break down each of these:

### Images

Images serve as blueprints for containers. They encapsulate the following components:

- Runtime environment (e.g., specific Node.js version)
- Application code
- Dependencies
- Configuration (e.g., environment variables)
- Additional instructions (e.g., commands)

Images also have their own file system, which is independent of the host system. Importantly, images are read-only; once created, they cannot be altered. Any modifications necessitate the creation of a new image.

### Containers

Containers are runnable instances of images. When an image is executed, it spawns a container, which operates as a process. Containers adhere to the specifications outlined in the corresponding image. Key characteristics of containers include:

- Isolated processes: Containers run independently from other processes on the host system.
- Self-contained environments: Each container contains everything necessary to run the application, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Implications

Understanding the relationship between images and containers yields several advantages:

- **Portability**: Docker images can be shared across different environments, guaranteeing consistent execution irrespective of underlying system configurations.
- **Isolation**: Applications run within containers, ensuring they remain insulated from other processes on the host system.
- **Consistency**: By packaging dependencies and configurations with the application code, Docker facilitates reproducible environments across development, testing, and production stages.
