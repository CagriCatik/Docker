## Volumes Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll dive into the concept of volumes in Docker. Volumes in Docker allow us to persist data and share information between the host machine and Docker containers. We'll learn how to implement volumes effectively in our Docker workflow.

### Introduction to Volumes

Volumes in Docker serve as a way to manage persistent data that can be shared among containers and the host machine. By using volumes, we can ensure that data remains intact even if the container is stopped or removed. This is particularly useful for scenarios where we need to preserve data generated or modified within containers.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

In the YouTube video, the presenter demonstrates an issue where changes made to the source code inside a Docker container are not reflected in the running application. This happens because Docker containers are immutable, meaning once an image is built, any changes made inside the container do not persist unless explicitly saved using volumes.

### Step 2: Making Changes to the Dockerfile

To address this issue, we'll modify the Dockerfile to incorporate volume mapping. Specifically, we'll ensure that our project folder on the host machine is mapped to the `app` folder inside the Docker container. Additionally, we'll manage the `node_modules` folder separately to prevent potential conflicts.

### Step 3: Implementing Volume Mapping

We'll update the Dockerfile and Docker run command to include volume mapping. This ensures that changes made to the project folder on the host machine are reflected inside the container.

### Step 4: Testing the Setup

Finally, we'll test our setup by making changes to the source code within the project folder and verifying that these changes are reflected in the running application without the need to rebuild the Docker image.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Update Dockerfile**: Modify the Dockerfile to include instructions for installing nodemon globally and configuring the startup command to use nodemon.
2. **Modify Docker Run Command**: Adjust the Docker run command to include volume mapping. Map the project folder on the host machine to the `app` folder inside the container.
3. **Handle Node Modules**: Address potential issues with the `node_modules` folder by managing it separately using an anonymous volume.
4. **Test Changes**: Make changes to the source code within the project folder and verify that these changes are reflected in the running application.
